# Ilikia

*Ilikia* is an exam application tool for elderly care. It was developed as a prototype proposal for the Club del Abuelo elderly care home in Zapopan, MÃ©xico.

Users can apply Mini-Mental State Examinations to assess a patient's mental condition. Geriatricians and other medical staff can consult these results from within the app.

## Features

- Take Mini-Mental State Examinations
- Store results including date on a per-user basis
- Display results from a geriatician's assigned patients

## How to run

1. Make sure an `ilikia` database with the tables in `server/Ilikia.sql` exists in your local MySQL server

    - Optional: Add the data contained in `server/test_data.sql` to experiment

2. Run the following in a command line at the root of the project

        npm install
        npm run build
        npm start

3. Open web app on `localhost:3001`
